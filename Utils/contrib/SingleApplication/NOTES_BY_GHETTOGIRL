I've modified this class a little bit to fit my needs.

New:
 void printInstanceRunningMessage() const;
 
 signal(SIGHUP, SingleApplicationPrivate::terminate);


Print a message, when the user tries to execute an additional instance of the application.

In my case it's the header text and a notification about a running instance ;)

Also terminate application if the parent process ( which is a terminal emulator ) dies.
