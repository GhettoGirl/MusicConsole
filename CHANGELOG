[everything before]

 Private, never released!
 Don't ask for source code or change log.


0.45-7
======

 × Initial public release


0.45-8
======

 × Add ability to read tags at startup
 × Code clean up


0.50-1
======

 × Better player handling
   ~ removed extra '_args' keys
   ~ %f is replaced with file path
 × Player overrides per file type
   Example: ext_player=PlayerForExt -args %f


0.50-2
======

 × Fixed 'exit' command
   Application cleans up probably now
 × Improved the command line history manager a bit


0.50-3
======

 × Bug fix: 'exit' command string not loaded from config file


0.51-1
======

 × New: media cache which holds all the tags so they must not be re-read all the time
        this significantly improves startup times and general performance
   
   the media cache recreates the cached file if the original file has changed on disk

 × Change: config->readtagsatstartup now defaults to true
           the first startup takes a lot of time, let it work and create the cache

   it is recommended to leave this setting on, since it improves the search algorithm


0.52-1
======

 × Improved the media cache
   Now it stores everything except the file path. This heavily improves the startup time.
   
   REMOVE YOUR OLD CACHE DIRECTORY BEFORE UPDATING!
   ~/.config/GhettoGirl/Music Console/cache

 × Removed the ability to disable tag reading at startup
   Let the application create its cache for the first time and enjoy fast startups afterwards.
   
 × Some code cleanup
   Removed some unnecessary variables


0.53-1
======

 × New filter command |wg (without genre)
   Filter out tracks which matches the given genre

 × Updated Media structure and the media cache
   
   REMOVE YOUR OLD CACHE DIRECTORY BEFORE UPDATING!
   ~/.config/GhettoGirl/Music Console/cache

 × Performance improvements in the search algorithm


0.53-2
======

 × Improved the RNG a bit
   There was a very rare chance, that the RNG returned the same number twice in a row.
   This can become very annoying if you 'shuffle' through you library and hear the
   same song twice. This behavior is now fixed, by storing the last number and add a
   check, which generates a new number if it maches the last one :)


0.53-3
======

 × Updated default file type filters


0.53-4
======

 × Minor Improvements
 × Fixed a typo in the README


0.53-5
======

 × Minor code cleanup


0.53-6
======

 × Several code cleanups
 × Change of coding style
